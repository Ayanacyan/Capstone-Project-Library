    <h4>Restart- Chase Ambrose doesn’t remember falling off the roof. He doesn’t remember hitting his head. In fact, he doesn’t remember anything. He wakes up in a hospital room and suddenly has to learn his whole life over again … starting with his own name.

Okay, he’s Chase. But who is Chase? Soon he’s hearing stories of the alpha jock and bully who held a reign of terror over an entire school. Is that the person he was … and is destined to be again?

Is it possible to restart?</h4>
<h4>Linked- Link, Michael, and Dana live in a quiet town. But it’s woken up very quickly when someone sneaks into the school and vandalizes it with a swastika. Who would do such a thing?

Because Michael was first to see it, he’s the first suspect. Because Link is the most popular guy in school, everyone’s expecting him to figure it out. And because Dana’s the only Jewish girl in town, people are treating her more like an outsider than ever.

Then more swastikas begin to appear. Some students fight back and start an epic project to bring people together instead of dividing them further – a paper chain six million links long. The closer Link, Michael, and Dana get to the truth, the more there is to face – not just the crimes of the present, but also the crimes of the past.</h4>
<h4>Catching a Story Fish-Keet, a girl from Alabama, loves language and storytelling, but her family's move to Illinois makes her feel silenced. . . . Harrington perfectly captures her character's growth by using all the tools poetry provides: artfully chosen words, thought-provoking metaphors, appropriate rhythm and pacing, and changing points of view. . . . Harrington also includes various poetic forms and a postscript offering additional information about each of them: an unusual addition for a title of this format. . . . Keet's is a simple and familiar-feeling story, but one that is understated, fully realized, deftly written, and utterly absorbing.</h4>
<h4>The Wild Journey of Juniper Berry- Eleven-year-old Juniper Berry lives with her family deep in the wild woods. Living off the grid is pretty exciting, but her happy life in the wild ends abruptly when her younger brother gets sick, and they move to the city to be closer to the hospital. Juniper and her older sister end up attending public school for the first time, which is harder to navigate than the woods ever were. As the hospital bills for her brother start piling up, Juniper knows they'll need to be paid before the family can go back to the woods, so she decides to make enough money to help out. With her cousin Alayna's support, Juniper starts posting videos filled with her wisdom from the woods, hoping to get a following. While she's stuck in the city, she might as well make the most of it, right?</h4>
<h4>Virtually Me- The pandemic was rough on everyone, especially since school went from being a fun place where you could hang out with your friends to a bunch of heads in small rectangles all trying to talk at once. For Bradley, Edelle, Hunter, Jasper, and Keiko, that’s about to change.For each of them, that presents an opportunity to become someone they’re not, or someone they haven’t been. For Bradley, it’s a chance to come out of a self-imposed shell. Edelle hopes everyone will see her for who she really is, not just for how she looks. Hunter is looking forward to pretending he’s still the person he was last year. Jasper wants to get over past assumptions. And for Keiko, it’ll allow her to disappear into the crowd.</h4>

    <h4>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone- Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by a beetle-eyed giant of a man, enrols at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch, and does battle in a deadly duel. The Reason, Harry Potter is a wizard!"</h4>
    <h4>Keepers of the Lost Cities- But Sophie still has secrets, and they’re buried deep in her memory for good reason: The answers are dangerous and in high demand. What is her true identity, and why was she hidden among humans? The truth could mean life or death—and time is running out.</h4>
    <h4>Amari and the Night Brothers-Amari who is recently introduced to the supernatural world, must compete for a spot against kids who’ve known about magic their whole lives. No matter how hard she tries, Amari can’t seem to escape their intense doubt and scrutiny—especially once her supernaturally enhanced talent is deemed “illegal.” With an evil magician threatening the supernatural world, and her own classmates thinking she’s an enemy, Amari has never felt more alone. But if she doesn’t stick it out and pass the tryouts, she may never find out what happened to her brother Quinton.</h4>
    <h4>Percy Jackson and the Lightning theif- Percy was just a normal kid, going to school, playing basketball, skateboarding. The usual. Until he accedentily vapourized his maths teacher. Now he spends his time battling monsters and generally staying alive. This is the one where Zeus, god of the sky, thinks he has stolen his lightning bolt-and making Zeus angry is a very bad idea. He goes on a quest to retreive the bolt before the solstice or else the sky and sea would war. Will he be successful? </h4>

    <h4>Space Case-One night, Dash has to make the trek across the campus to the bathroom after one of the meals makes him ill. The toilets are complicated pieces of equipment and Dash's breaks before he is finished. While he is struggling to make the repairs, Dr. Ronald Holtz arrives. He is the doctor for the small community and is well-liked. Dash hears Dr. Holtz saying he plans to make a major announcement the following day and Dash is excited for any potential change in the sheer monotony of this life. However, he wakes the following morning to discover that Dr. Holtz left the buildings of the MBA and died on the moon's surface. Remembering that Dr. Holtz had seemed excited about his plans for an announcement, Dash immediately suspects foul play.</h4>
    <h4>Star Wars: Clone Wars: The Slave Traders of Zygeria-Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi have discovered the dastardly plot of Count Dooku—the entire population of the planet Kiros are in danger!
Along with fresh new Padawan Ahsoka Tano—Anakin and Obi-Wan have liberated the droid-occupied planet and halted its destruction, but the native Togruta people have disappeared… Now, our Jedi must find the missing citizens, before Count Dooku can carry out his master plan!</h4>
<h4>The Giver-  Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests.</h4>
<h4>A Rover's Story- Resilience, a Mars rover, from the moment he becomes aware of his existence. As a robot, Resilience should not experience human emotions. However, as he learns and grows fond of the scientists in his lab, he begins to incorporate human emotions into his vocabulary and perception, often imparting this capacity to the other robots he interacts with. Through relationships with scientists Xander and Rania, as well as with another rover named Journey, Resilience grapples with what makes him similar to Journey but different from Rania and Xander. As Resilience matures, he comes to understand and appreciate his purpose.</h4>
